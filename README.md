Geonames Query Web Demo

Author: Alberto Amaro

According to IATI 2.01, the location the codes related with the geographical information can be extracted from the following Dictionaries: 

Code | Name | URL
-----| ---- | ----------
A1 | Global Admininistrative Unit Layers | http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=12691 
A2 | UN Second Administrative Level Boundary Project | http://www.unsalb.org 
A3 | Global Administrative Areas | http://www.gadm.org 
A4 | ISO Country (3166-1 alpha-2) | http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.htm 
G1 | Geonames | http://www.geonames.org 
G2 | OpenStreetMap | http://www.openstreetmap.org 

This web has been created to make easier the location of: Identifiers, Names, Administrative Units and Latitude-Longitude coordinates using the public and free database: 

[GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org) (GeoNames is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License) 

There are two options: 
1. MENU OPTION: Administrative Units 
 Identifying a location through its Administrative hierarchy from the top level (continent) to the third level. 
2. MENU OPTION: Places Location 
 Taking advantage of the Google Geocoder to identify a geographical name and, once the place is selected between the possibilities offered by Google, this application makes a query to the GeoNames Database to show a list of possible locations founded. 

Using the Copy (Ctrl-C)-Paste (Ctrl-V) navigator options you can select a name, code or coordinate to move this information to other application or web page. 

This is only a Demo version with a limitation of queries per day.
